## test_for_MindSet
Test work for an internship at **MindSet**

### TASK 1
#### Since it was necessary to check the performance of several libraries, each of which pulls its own dependencies, it was easier for me to complete this task in PyCharm with a separate virtual environment for the project.
To run **task_1.py** you should add photos to directory **pass_photos/**
Requires library preinstallation **PIL** and **Tesseract-OSR** with Russian *"traineddata"*

Text recognition is poor. But it turned out to be the easiest and most effective way of all that I tried before. Other libraries either do not recognize the Russian language at all, or had to face a huge number of problems during the installation process, or the volume of recognized text is even lower.

### TASK 2
I used the Yandex Cloud API
To execute this code, you need to follow the instructions for create Yandex.Cloud accaunt and obtaining the primary Yandex.ID token:
